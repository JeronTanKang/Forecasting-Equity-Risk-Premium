Function for random forest h step ahead forecast. 
To be used in the model code chunk in forecast_evaluation.rmd. 

NOTE: hardcoded hyperparameter values are taken from the individual tuning scripts

```{r}
model <- function(df, h) {
  df_std = df %>% mutate(across(-c(date, erp), ~ as.numeric(scale(.)))) %>% arrange(date)
  df_std = df_std %>% mutate(target = lead(erp, n = h)) %>% select(date, target, everything())

  df_forecast = df_std %>% slice(n()-h+1)
  df_train = df_std %>% slice(1:(n() - h))

  feats <- setdiff(names(df_std), c("date", "target"))

  x_train <- df_train[, feats, drop=FALSE]
  y_train <- df_train$target

  x_forecast <- df_forecast[, feats, drop=FALSE]
  y_forecast <- df_forecast$target

  set.seed(456857)
  p <- ncol(x_train)

  # mtry = 8 is tuned value
  rf_fit <- randomForest(
    x = x_train,
    y = y_train,
    ntree=5000,
    mtry = 8,
    importance = TRUE
  )

  pred <- predict(rf_fit, newdata = x_forecast)
  return(pred)
